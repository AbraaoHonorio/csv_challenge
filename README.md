# CSV Challenge


CSV Challenge is a Python command-line application that processes CSV files and outputs the results in CSV format. Deliverables
You will be provided with a list of legislators, bills, votes, and vote results as specified above. Youâ€™ll be asked to answer the following questions:
1. Forevery legislator in the dataset,how many bills did the legislator support(voted forthe bill)? How many bills did the legislator oppose?
2. Forevery bill in the data set, how many legislator ssupported the bill? Howmany legislators opposed the bill? Who was the primary sponsor of the bill?


# Answers
1 - Time complexity is Linear time complexity O(n) means that the algorithms take proportionally longer to complete as the input grows, that is, for each line of Vote_Result.csv, but I can this result because I spent more memory(with use of a dictionary). 

2 - In case has in some CSV already there is, should create a new property in Class that the CSV represented, but if it has its own CSV file , then the written script would have to iterate again, and match with the ID to get the information requested. The same logic follows Bill Voted.

3 - It would totally remove the csv reading issue, turn that list into a dictionary as I did and follow the same current flow with both processors

4 - 4 hours(but I can't work 4 hours straight)
